# Login-Page
This login page is completely designed and developed by me as a creative exercise to make a visually appealing login page. It is not a functional login system but rather a static page created using HTML and CSS. While the majority of the work is my own, I did seek assistance from AI for a few specific parts, such as properly aligning and rotating elements and understanding 1-2 concepts that I incorporated into the design. This project reflects my effort to practice and refine my front-end development skills while experimenting with design ideas.
